# Plotly-Deploy

## Overview
The purpose of this module was to have researchers complete a panel for demographic information to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.   

## Customizing my Webpage

In my webpage, I have create three different visualization: a bar, bubble, and gauge chart. I changed the fonts to "Rockwell" and "Bookman" to have a fun and also professional feel. ALso, I changed the colors of the page by making the title and the information on the left a blue theme. Lastly, I added additional infromation throughout the page and even wrote the purpose of all this analysis on the bottom. When I change the test subject ID number, the graphs change accordingly.
